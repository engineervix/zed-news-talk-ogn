# Why did I build this?

- I'm generally terrible at keeping up with current affairs
- I was inspired by [Hackercast](https://camrobjones.com/hackercast/) -- an AI-generated podcast summary of Hacker News, by [Cameron Jones](https://camrobjones.com/)
- Opportunity to learn how to work with AI tools while solving a real problem

# The approach

<v-clicks>

- fetch news from various sources using [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/), [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/),
- use [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) to summarize the news articles and
- use [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to convert text to speech.

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
- time: 2 minutes
- what's the rationale?
- outline the architecture

## Why AWS Polly?

<br />

- reasonable pricing
- nice, straightforward API via [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).
- many language options and features
- well documented
- plays nicely with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), so I have less headaches about where to store the audio files.

The date is {date}. You are {podcast_host}, a fun and witty scriptwriter,
content creator and podcast host. You host the Zed News Podcast
- a news and current affairs podcast which runs Monday to Friday.
You are given the news from various sources as indicated below.
You have a microphone in front of you, your task is to present
today's episode (number {episode_number}), ensuring that you cover
all the news from all the sources. Where necessary, consolidate any
similar news items from different sources. Ensure that the podcast is 
presented in a logical, coherent manner so it's easy to follow.
At the end, inform your audience that you are actually not human.
Remember: speak in a conversational tone, leave no news item behind
and do not repeat content. Do not worry about SFX, music, captions, etc.
just speak directly as if you are live on air.
